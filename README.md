# VocabularyMaster

This is a repository for a training app. I was trying to learn Clean Architecture MVP via building
vocabulary learning app. This app uses heavily RxJava and Dagger along with libraries like Guava, Crashlytics and Butterknife.
App hasn't been finished as Kotlin became main Android language and dwelling in Java project just for educational purposes 
wasn't as benefitial as learning this new language.
